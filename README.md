NetAssist Technical Architecture Overview
1. Programming Foundation:

    Language: Python 3

    Environment: Designed for Linux (ArcoLinux/Ubuntu) and WSL compatibility

    Runtime Dependencies: Minimal (only colorama, psutil required)

2. Major Python Libraries:

    Built-in Standard: os, sys, importlib, readline, datetime, logging, requests, platform, json, random, time, threading, ipaddress, subprocess

    Third-Party: colorama (terminal styling), psutil (system stats)

3. Core Functional Modules:
Category	Modules	Description
Networking	network_tools, scan_manager	Lookups, subnet scans, live dashboards
System Ops	system_tools, dashboard_tools, repair_tools	Monitoring and maintenance
Security	security_tools, rce_tools	SSL checking, Whois, CVE feeds, remote device management
Utilities	notes_tools, crypto_tools, weather_tools, fun_tools	Fun and user productivity
Presentation	ascii_art, help_tools	ASCII animations, advanced help system

4. External Public APIs:  Service	Purpose
ZenQuotes (zenquotes.io)	Fetches motivational quotes for startup MOTD
IPInfo (ipinfo.io)	Resolves external IP to geolocation
Ipify (api.ipify.org)	Retrieves external IP address
HackerTarget Whois API (api.hackertarget.com)	WHOIS lookups for domain research
NVD CVE Feed (services.nvd.nist.gov)	Real-time cyber threat feed (CVEs)

5. Security & Design Notes:

    No persistent sensitive data stored
    Authentication prompts are handled safely (masked input)
    APIs used are read-only and public-facing

    Highly modular â€” each function independently callable

    Minimal CPU/RAM load â€” real-time dashboard optimized

    Silent error handling built in (graceful for user experience)

 Executive Summary

NetAssist is a modular, operator-optimized CLI toolkit for network engineers, system administrators, and tech specialists.
It consolidates diagnostics, remote management, threat awareness, and fun tools into a single cohesive platform â€” with security and simplicity as core design pillars
